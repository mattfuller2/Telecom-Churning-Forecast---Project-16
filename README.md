# Telecom-Churning-Forecast---Project-16

# Telecom Churn Forecasting Project

## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to forecast customer churn for a telecom operator, **Interconnect**. Churn prediction is critical for customer retention, as it allows the business to proactively target at-risk customers. This project involved cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, and training various machine learning models to predict customer churn. The models were evaluated using the **AUC-ROC** score, with the final solution being an ensemble model that combined several individual models to improve performance.
